# toolkit
for the cell classification script, you will need a 'ref_list.xlsx'
and a 'fileName.xlsx' -> which will include a list of file names to look for in the directory for example:  
      you have the fallowing files in 'new_seurat' directory -> genelist1.xlsx, genelist2.xlsx, genelist3.xlsx
      Now in fileName.xlsx file you will list the file names without the file extensions ->  genelist1
                                                                                             genelist2
                                                                                             genelist3
